        <h2>What is a Pinto Bean?</h2>
        <p>The pinto bean (/ˈpɪntoʊ/) is a variety of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). In Spanish they are called frijoles pintos. It is the most popular bean by crop production in Northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States,[3][4] and is most often eaten whole (sometimes in broth), or mashed and then refried. Prepared either way, it is a common filling for burritos, tostadas, or tacos in Mexican cuisine,[5] also as a side or as part of an entrée served with a side tortilla or sopaipilla in New Mexican cuisine.[6]</p>
