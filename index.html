        <h3>Bean</h3>
        <p>A bean is the seed of several plants in the family Fabaceae (legumes) which are used as vegetables for human consumption or animal food.[1] The seeds are often preserved through drying, but fresh beans are also sold. Most beans are traditionally soaked and boiled, but they can be cooked in many different ways,[2] including frying and baking, and are used in many traditional dishes throughout the world. The unripe seedpods of some varieties are also eaten whole as green beans, which can be eaten raw, as well as edamame (immature soybean), but fully ripened beans contain toxins like phytohemagglutinin and require cooking.</p>
